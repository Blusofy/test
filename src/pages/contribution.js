                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem
                Ipsum has been the s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
                printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
                survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
                remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
                Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
                publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. Why do
                we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
                readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem
                Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to
                using making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web
                page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for will
                uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over
                the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the
                like).
